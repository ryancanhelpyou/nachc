Add workflow processes to your Gravity Forms.

== Description ==

Gravity Flow is a business process workflow platform for WordPress.


= Who is it for? =

Gravity Flow is for organisations and departments of any size that need to get a form-based workflow process up and running online quickly with no programming. These processes usually already exist either offline or online but are often inefficiently implemented.

= How does it work? =

An end-user submits a web form which generates an entry. The entry is then passed around between users and systems on an established path until the process is complete. Each user or system in the workflow will add something to the process before allowing the entry to proceed to the next step.

For example, an employee may add additional information and a manager another might add their approval. Connected systems might send an email, add the user to a mailing list, create a user account or send data to an ERP system.
